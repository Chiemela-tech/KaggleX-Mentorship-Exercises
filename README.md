# KaggleX-Mentorship-Exercises
>This repository contains all the exercises and projects from my learnings as a Google KaggleX Mentee Cohort 2
> I partook in several exercises on the Kagglelearn platform


>A major highlight is the final project, where I conducted an exploratory data analysis on the possibilities of heart attacks
>The final project is a glimpse of what I had learned as a KaggleX mentee, from Pandas to Data Visualizations, Intro to Machine Learning and Google Cloud Big Data and machine learning

Below is a list of commits in the right flow:
* Pandas - renaming and combining: Rename and combine codes
* Exercise - line charts: Codes to draw a line chart of a dataset
* Fork of exercise - bar charts and heatmaps: Write code to visualize in bar charts and show relationships in a heatmap
* Fork of exercise - scatter plots: Visualize and show relationships of variables with scatter plots
* EDA for the possibilities of heart attack: My final project as a Kaggle mentee shows visualizations of several possibilities of heart attack. It incorporates CSS and HTML codes to beautify the Kaggle notebook- https://www.kaggle.com/code/chiemelachinedum/eda-for-the-possibilities-of-heart-attack. Please check this out
